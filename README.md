The Cleveland Tech Survey
======

Cleveland is a special place. Lots of the information provided by survey-type sites (Glassdoor, Stack Overflow, etc.) doesn't seem to accurately represent Cleveland. So the Cleveland Tech Survey is an attempt to help us learn more about what it's like to work in tech in Cleveland.

Pull requests are welcome!
