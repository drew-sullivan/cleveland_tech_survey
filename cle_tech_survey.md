# cle_tech_survey

## Ideas for later




## Backlog

* Add yaxis titles back in to the needed charts

* Add 'years' to tooltips in years of experience tab

* Instead of getting all users from the db, just get all the user attributes you’re looking for. Like, get a list of the tech_roles for every user. Then turn that into a pd_series, instead of going through a whole df

* Set up logging

* Create Unit test goals

* Add 'Please rotate device for xs screen' (It looks bad without it)

* Add FAQ page

* Set up email to another account

* SSL?

* Remove avatar stuff from db

* Remove about me from db

* linting

## Done
